# IAED-Project2
This is my second project for my class of Introduction to algorithms and data structures, which is basically the same as the first one (which can be found [here](https://github.com/AfonsoCalinas/IAED-Project1)), but now we were requested to use dynamic memory allocation.

This project's statement is here > [enunciado.md](enunciado.md)

Some guidelines to how you should approach it [guidelines.md](guidelines.md), and some more usefull information here [information.md](information.md), the same as before.

There's 32 available tests of input right in [public-tests](public-tests), so you can test your code (these 32 are the private tests from the first project).

My project is [project2.c](project2.c), and is currently giving green light in 9 of the 32 private tests that school inputs in our code. The second phase of this project didn't go that well because dynamic memory allocation was a little hard to understand at first.
